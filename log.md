**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

## Day 1: March 5, 2017

**Today's progress**: 
In the project Fixed Position Testing the display issue of all first letters in each paragraph being resized was fixed. Now only the first letter of the first paragraph in each section is enlarged. It took alot of experimenting until I figured out that the sibling selector will accomplish what I want done

In the project Calculator I moved all interactivity into the javascript file. The errorthat happened when the equal sign was pressed multiple times after a problem was fixed.

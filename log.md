##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Day 1: March 5, 2017

**Today's progress**: 
In the project Fixed Position Testing the display issue of all first letters in each paragraph being resized was fixed. Now only the first letter of the first paragraph in each section is enlarged. It took alot of experimenting until I figured out that the sibling selector will accomplish what I want done

In the project Calculator I moved all interactivity into the javascript file. The errorthat happened when the equal sign was pressed multiple times after a problem was fixed.

##Day 2: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on the css for the FreeCodeCamp Tic Tac Toe game. It was smooth sailing until I  added in the X's and O's. Each time an X or O was place in a div the div would sink into the row beneath it. To fix this issue I set padding and margin to the p to 0%. Tic Tac Toe now looks decent on a mobile device.
